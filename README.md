# Space_Shooter_Game
This is a Turtle Module based game that I made in Python, it let's you pilot a spaceship through a vast space world, blasting color-matched blocks to score points, collecting health powerups & dodging collisions. 
Features include shooting, movement boost, block clusters, and color-based scoring.
